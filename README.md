## A Collection of Custom UI Elements in Vanilla Javascript
Dependency-free and fairly simple ui widgets (some of which should probably not be widgets at all, but here we are).

Goals for each are:
1. to conform to the [Custom Elements Specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#custom-elements),
2. to be styleable with .css in the normal way,
3. to be themeable via `document.documentElement.setAttribute("window-theme", "theme-name");`
4. to be easy and sane to use

Would **love** to receive any feedback, issues, or contributions!
